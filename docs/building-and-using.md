# Building and Using QCoro

## Building QCoro

QCoro uses CMake build system. You can pass following options to the `cmake` command when building
QCoro to customize the build:

* `-DQCORO_BUILD_EXAMPLES` - whether to build examples or not (`ON` by default).
* `-DQCORO_ENABLE_ASAN` - whether to build QCoro with AddressSanitizer (`OFF` by default).
* `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS` - whether to build QCoro as a shared library (`OFF` by default).
* `-DQCORO_BUILD_TESTING` - whether to build tests (`ON` by default).
* `-DUSE_QT_VERSION` - set to `5` or `6` to force a particular version of Qt. When not set the highest available version is used.
* `-DQCORO_WITH_QTDBUS` - whether to compile support for QtDBus (`ON` by default).
* `-DQCORO_WITH_QTNETWORK` - whether to compile support for QtNetwork (`ON` by default).
* `-DQCORO_WITH_QTWEBSOCKETS` - whether to compile support for QtWebSockets (`ON` by default).
* `-DQCORO_DISABLE_DEPRECATED_TASK_H` - will not build and install the deprecated task.h header (`OFF` by default).

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. <CMAKE FLAGS>
make
# This will install QCoro into /usr/local/ prefix, change it by passing -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
# to the cmake command above.
sudo make install
```

## CMake

Depending on whether you want to use Qt5 or Qt6 build of QCoro, you should use `QCoro5` or QCoro6` in your
CMake code, respectively. The example below is assuming Qt6:

```cmake
# Use QCoro5 if you are building for Qt5!
find_package(QCoro6 REQUIRED COMPONENTS Core Network DBus)

# Set necessary compiler flags to enable coroutine support
qcoro_enable_coroutines()

...

target_link_libraries(your-target QCoro::Core QCoro::Network QCoro::DBus)
```

Note the missing Qt version number in the `QCoro` target namespace: QCoro provides both
versioned (`QCoro5` and `QCoro6`) namespaces as well as version-less namespace, which is
especially useful for transitioning codebase from Qt5 to Qt6.

## QMake

Using QCoro with QMake projects (`.pro`) is simple: just add the required QCoro modules to the `QT`
variable:

```
QT += QCoroCore QCoroNetwork QCoroDBus
# Enable C++20
CONFIG += c+=20
# Enable coroutine support in the compiler
QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -fcoroutines
```

You don't need to worry about Qt5 vs Qt6, qmake will pick up the correct build of QCoro depending
on whether you are using QMake for Qt5 or Qt6.

Currently it's necessary to manually enable C++20 and coroutine support (unless that's already
default in your system/compiler settings).
